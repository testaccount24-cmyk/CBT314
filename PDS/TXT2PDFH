  04/17/09 - LLL - Added TrueType font embedding and subsetting.  The
                     XFONT keyword was updated to specify the fonts.
                   Added the DELIM keyword to allow using characters
                     other the "/" as the parameter separator.
                   Added the ENCODING keyword to provide support for
                     Unicode.
                   Added new font name parameter to the TMARK type
                     of the BG keyword.
                   Added ROWCOL subtype to the ATTR type of the TEXT
                     keyword.
                   Object lengths are no longer forward references to
                     separate objects, somewhat reducing PDF size.
                   Fixed control character initialization so that it
                     they are translated properly.
                   Made sure all SELECTs had an OTHERWISE to make the
                     REXX compiler happier.
                   More minor cleanup.

  11/31/08 - LLL - Changed license to GPLv2 from QPL.  There were
                   companies wanting to distribute TXT2PDF with their
                   product and the QPL was too restrictive.

                   Even though the GPL allows it, I hope the companies
                   do not try to make money off of TXT2PDF since I
                   was kind enough to make it easier to redistribute.
                   May a pox be on them if they do.  :-)

  11/06/08 - LLL - Added support for ooRexx (based on Lionel's code)
                   Limit parameter precision in image positioning
                     since Acrobat Reader 9 can't deal with more than
                     20 digits to the right of the decimal.
                   Fixed Regina/Uni-rexx stdin/stdout handling.
                   Converted message table to stem for easier
                     compiling. (Joe Smidel)
                   Conversion table usage was reversed.
                   Added COMPRESS to TXT2PDFD.
                   Minor cosmetic clean up here and there.

  06/27/08 - LBD - Update to return Version if called txt2pdf(ver)
                   (thanks to Hartmut)

  11/08/07 - LBD - Added sample XLATE006 from Josef Berger for German

  10/12/06 - LBD - Updated panels T2PH0 and T2PPD to mention that the

                   in binary.

  03/17/04 - LLL - Fixed stdin/stdout I/O for Regina and Uni-rexx.
                   Added 1, 4, 8, and 24 bit UNCOMPRESSED BMP image
                     file support.
                   Added new TILE action to the IMAGE parameter.

  03/03/04 - LLL - Added OMVS support. (Larry)

  02/16/04 - LLL - Further suggestions from Hartmut to allow easier
                   use of TXT2PDF on "non-English" systems.

                   While this change was "minor" in complexity, it
                   did involve some global (hahaha) changes.  So, you
                   might want to do a little extra testing before
                   using in production.

                   Those changes were to replace all "\" characters
                   and make locating "|" characters easier.

  02/14/04 - LLL - Contribution from Lionel to base CC on RECFM under
                     TSO instead of forcing to NO.  This is the way
                     it SHOULD have been all along, so it's my fault
                     for the behavior change.

                   NOTE:  Since this changes prior behavior, make
                          CERTAIN you check your jobs to verify that
                          either you have specified CC or you are
                          okay with allowing TXT2PDF to decide for
                          you.

                   Added 2 arguments to the IMAGE DRAW paramenter that
                     allow you to specify the page number and interval
                     at which the image should be drawn. (Perry)
                   Added automatic page sizing based on the largest
                     IMAGE printed on the page. (Perry)
                   Added (unverified) Turkish cset support. (Ibrahim)
                   Changed the way barred and holed paper is drawn.
                     Acrobat's TABLE SELECTION TOOL doesn't work when
                     a PDF contains Form XObjects.  (Well that's what
                     I "think" the reason is.)  'Sides, the new way
                     produces smaller PDFs.  (Len)
                   Large images brought out a bug that's probably
                     been there since the 03/01/2002 update.
                     (Thanks to Perry for reporting this one!)
                   Added DEFCFG parameter to allow specification of
                     a default CONFIG file name.  This would be used
                     in your local TXT2PDFD EXEC. (Perry)
                   Added XLATE parameter to allow you to change the
                     translation tables at runtime.  This allows
                     you to override any tables set with the TXT2PDFX
                     EXEC. (Hartmut)
                   Added TEXT parameter for changing the appearance
                     of the input text. (Charles)

  10/26/03 - LLL - Fixed missing font error when using DRAW TEXT and
                     no background

                   Added STRING type to DRAW keyword (Len)
                   Added ability to specify date/time formats in

                     stdin and stdout
                   Messages are written to stderr on platforms that
