The ZOSLOG ISPF Dialog found in this package will present the user with a list
of all syslog log files in the z/OS system and allow the user to select a file
to Browse, or View.

The only customization required is to verify/update the hlq for the syslog
datasets variable in the exec and for the dataset name date.

Members of this PDS are:

    $DOC    - what you are reading
    EXEC    - TSO Transmit of the REXX Library
    PANELS  - TSO Transmit of the ISPF Panel Library
    $RECV   - TSO Command to RECEIVE EXEC and PANELS into
              usable datasets
