zClone is an ISPF Dialog that will compare two, non-load library,
partitioned datasets. The user will be presented with a ISPF table with
all the members listed along with the status of each member. The status
will indicate if the member is eligible to be copied.

All standard ISPF services are used with the exception of STEMEDIT that
is used to view the results of the ISPF SuperC comparison results.

See the ISPF tutorial for additional inforamtion.

The syntax is:

   %zClone from-pds to-pds

The from and to pds's are optional and if not provided the user will be
prompted for them.

Dependencies:  Requires STEMEDIT from CBT file 895.
