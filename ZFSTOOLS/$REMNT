ZFSRMNT is an ISPF dialog to simplify changing the mount attributes of a
mounted zFS from RO to RW and vice versa using the UNMOUNT command with
the REMOUNT option - it's a toggle.

This is an alternative to ISPF 3.17 with no need to enter the su command
to gain authorization.

Dependencies:  1. User must be able to get SuperUser uid:0
                  to use the UNMOUNT command
                  - See Facility Class BPX.SUPERUSER
               2. Repeat Find (RFIND) requires that a
                  Command table entry be defined in the
                  site/user/ISPCMDS table thus:
                  Command: RFIND
                  Trunc:   0
                  Desc:    user repeat find
                  Action:  &USRRFIND
